### Final Project for Econometrics Course (Econ 35)

We use econometrics to analyze the effect of athletic participation on educational outcomes.
The data is taken from an Education Longitudinal Study collected by the U.S. Department of Education.

This project was completed by Sydney Levy, Brooke Coneeny, Eleanor Miller, and Ally Scheve for an Econometrics course at Swarthmore College.
